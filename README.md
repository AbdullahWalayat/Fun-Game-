# Fun-Game-
A fun clicking game, using HTML, CSS, Javascript

To make this project come to life, first create a new folder, then a html,css, and javascript file. Emulate the code from this page and have some fun. 
This project came from a youtube tutorial, with some changes from me, all as a part of learning and expanding on my knowledge in programming languages.
Always remember to learn and most importantly have fun with the code, you're working on, it makes the process way more enjoyable.
